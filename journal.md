# June 26th

I started working on getting the project setup. I removed the old files, updated the Ergogen code, and recreated the KiCAD project

Also, I use Ergogen to just [place the switches](https://github.com/adamws/kicad-kbplacer) on the PCB using a KiCAD. No actual PCB is generated by it.

## Schematic work

I'm mostly taking ideas and design from the amazing [ZMK Design guide](https://github.com/ebastler/zmk-designguide) and the work I've done for quiz-sys. I plan to re-use most of the components I did for the [Woagboard v0.2](https://github.com/suyashsurya/woagboard/tree/v0.2), but with everything completely re-done.

Fun thing for the BQ24075 is that I can just... Completely ignore the SYSOFF pin. ZMK has a soft-off mode that allows me to turn off and on the keyboard
through a button, so I'll be adding that to my design.

I decided to move a bunch of components in-line rather than putting them on a separate bit of the schematic, such as the low-power oscillator and DCCH inductor.
The design on the design guide confused me for the first time, since it didn't make sense to me. This makes it way clearer to my silly brain.

_Huh. That's a lot clearer than the decoupling capacitors being like 50 spaces away._

Not sure how I feel about the DCCH loop, but it works for now.

Also for the first time ever: I filled out the info block

_I'm pretty proud of this ngl_
